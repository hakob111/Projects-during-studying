No doublets!
We play dice. The rules are as follows:

1. Throw a couple of bones.

2. Add up the number of numbers drawn and add to the total number of points

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 three times.

4. If a doublet falls out (the same number on both dice), then the number of points is reset to zero and subsequent rolls are not counted.

Exercise:

Write a calc_dice_scores function that takes a list of tuples and returns the total score.

Call examples and expected result.

calc_dice_scores ([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]) ➞ 21
 
calc_dice_scores ([(1, 1), (5, 6), (6, 4)]) ➞ 0
 
calc_dice_scores ([(4, 5), (4, 5), (4, 5)]) ➞ 27

Three tuples of two elements each are always passed.
