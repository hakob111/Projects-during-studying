: Who shot faster?
Two participants p1 and p2 are dueling.

Write a function whos_first that takes two strings and returns the name of the player who fired first.

If the players fired at the same time, then return the string "tie".

Call and return examples:
whos_first(
 "   Bang!        ",
 "        Bang!   "
) ➞ "p1"
# p1 стреляет быстрее p2
whos_first(
 "               Bang! ",
 "             Bang!   "
) ➞ "p2"
whos_first(
 "     Bang!   ",
 "     Bang!   "
) ➞ "tie"

Note:

transmitted strings - can be of different lengths! (that is, contain a different number of spaces)
